                    The History of the Saxophone:
                </h1>
                <p> 
                    The saxophone was designed around 1840 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker, flautist, and clarinetist.
                    Born in Dinant and originally based in Brussels, he moved to Paris in 1842 to establish his musical instrument business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before working on the saxophone, he made several improvements to the bass clarinet by improving its keywork and acoustics and extending its lower range. 
                    Sax was also a maker of the ophicleide, a large conical brass instrument in the bass register with keys similar to a woodwind instrument. His experience with these two instruments allowed him to develop the skills and technologies needed to make the first saxophones.
                    As an outgrowth of his work improving the bass clarinet, Sax began developing an instrument with the projection of a brass instrument and the agility of a woodwind.
                    He wanted it to overblow at the octave, unlike the clarinet, which rises in pitch by a twelfth when overblown.

                <p>    
                    An instrument that overblows at the octave has identical fingering for both registers.
                    Sax created an instrument with a single-reed mouthpiece and conical brass body. Having constructed saxophones in several sizes in the early 1840s, Sax applied for, and received, a 15-year patent for the instrument on 28 June 1846.
                    The patent encompassed 14 versions of the fundamental design, split into two categories of seven instruments each, and ranging from sopranino to contrabass.
                    A limited number of instruments in the series pitched in F and C were produced by Sax, but the series pitched in E♭ and B♭ quickly became the standard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the instruments were given an initial written range from the B below the treble staff to the E♭ one half-step below the third ledger line above staff, giving each saxophone a range of two and a half octaves.
                    Sax's patent expired in 1866.[17] Thereafter, numerous other instrument manufacturers implemented their own improvements to the design and keywork.
                </p>

                 <p>    
                    Sax's original keywork, which was based on the Triebert system 3 oboe for the left hand and the Boehm clarinet for the right, was simplistic and made certain legato passages and wide intervals extremely difficult to finger; that system would later evolve with extra keys, linkage mechanisms, and alternate fingerings to make some intervals less difficult.
                    Early in the development of the saxophone the upper keyed range was extended to E, then F above the staff; 1880s era sheet music for saxophone was written for the range of low B to F.
                    In 1887 the Buffet-Crampon company obtained a patent for extending the bell and adding an extra key to extend the range downwards by one semitone to B♭.
                    This extension is currently standard in most modern designs, with the notable exception of baritone saxophones further extended and keyed to low A. The upper range to F would remain the standard for nearly a century until the altissimo F♯ key became common on modern saxophones.

                <p> 
                     Sax’s patent expired in 1866, enabling other instrument manufacturers to build new versions of the saxophone.
                    Early interest in the saxophone waned in Europe from 1870 to 1890, but it was steadily gaining in the United States as new musical styles became popular.
                    Vaudeville and ragtime laid the groundwork for dance orchestras and eventually jazz, greatly expanding the demand for saxophones. In the 1890s, C.G. Conn, a respected manufacturer of brass instruments, began production of saxophones in the United States, providing a much more reliable and available supply of the instruments.

                <p>
                    The modern layout of the saxophone emerged during the 1930s and 1940s, first with right-side bell keys introduced by C. G. Conn on baritones, then by King on altos and tenors.
                    In 1936, Selmer revolutionized the mechanics of the left hand table with their Balanced Action instruments, capitalizing on the right-side bell key layout. In 1948, Selmer introduced their Super Action models with right and left hand stack keys offset about 30 degrees apart, allowing for a more relaxed pose and greater dexterity on the keys. Selmer’s layout became the new standard and was adopted for virtually every saxophone being produced, from student to professional models.

                <p>  
                    Selmer’s Mark VI saxophones, manufactured from 1954 to 1974, are legendary. The horns are known for their tone and mechanical excellence, but music historians believe other factors contributed to the success of the Mark VI.
                    United States production of saxophones dropped during World War II because of the rationing of many metals, including copper and zinc, which make brass.

                <p>
                    Musicians seeking professional quality instruments turned to the more readily available Selmer saxophones.
                    The Mark VI’s allure was also enhanced by its production run that coincided almost perfectly with the golden era of modern jazz. 
                    Selmer produced between 150,000 and 200,000 Mark VI’s, most of which are still in circulation.
                    Price tags for this model are hefty, typically $10,000 or more.
