                        <h3>Kaori Kobayashi:</h3>
                        <p class="bio">
                            Kobayashi was born on October 20, 1981 in the Kanagawa Prefecture.
                            Her father was a photographer and her mother, a piano teacher.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            Beginning at a very young age, Kobayashi learned to play the piano.
                            When she was 13 years old she joined a brass band and started to play the flute.
                            Four years later she stopped playing in the band, instead choosing to start a relationship with the saxophone.
                            
                            <br>
                            Then she turned to jazz.

                            <br>

                            Another four years later, having learned from Bob Zangu how to play the saxophone in a jazz setting, she entered the Senzoku College of Music.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            After graduating, she got a contract with the label Victor Entertainment and her first album, Solar, appeared.
