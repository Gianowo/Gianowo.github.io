                        <h3>Kaori Kobayashi</h3>
                        <p class="bio">
                            Kaori Kobayashi was born on October 20, 1981 in the Kanagawa Prefecture.
                            Her father was a photographer and her mother, a piano teacher.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Beginning at a very young age, Kobayashi learned to play the piano.
                            When she was 13 years old she joined a brass band and started to play the flute.
                            Four years later she stopped playing in the band, instead choosing to start a relationship with the saxophone.
                            <br>
                            Then she turned to jazz.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another four years later, having learned from Bob Zangu how to play the saxophone in a jazz setting, she entered the Senzoku College of Music.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After graduating, she got a contract with the label Victor Entertainment and her first album, Solar, appeared.

                        <h3>Paul Desmond</h3>
                        <p class="bio">
                            Paul Desmond (born Paul Emil Breitenfeld, November 25, 1924 â€“ May 30, 1977) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and composer, best known for his work with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and for composing that group's biggest hit, "Take Five".
                            <br>
                            <br>        
                            He was one of the most popular musicians to come out of the cool jazz scene.
                            In addition to his work with Brubeck, 
                            <br
                            >he led several groups and collaborated with Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, Jim Hall, and Ed Bickert.
                            <br>
                            <br> 
                            After years of chain smoking and poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 after a tour with Brubeck.
                            Yet this was enough time for him to compose works of art which brought him fame.
