                            The soprano saxophone is a higher-register variety of the saxophone, a woodwind instrument, invented in the 1840s. 
                            The soprano is the third smallest member of the saxophone family, which consists (from smallest to largest) of the soprillo, sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass, contrabass saxophone and tubax.
                            Soprano saxophones are the smallest saxophone in common use.

                                It is pitched in Eâ™­, and is smaller than the tenor, but larger than the soprano.

                                The fingerings of the different saxophones are all the same so a saxophone player can play any type of saxophone.
